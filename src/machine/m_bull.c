/*
 * VARCem	Virtual ARchaeological Computer EMulator.
 *		An emulator of (mostly) x86-based PC systems and devices,
 *		using the ISA,EISA,VLB,MCA  and PCI system buses, roughly
 *		spanning the era between 1981 and 1995.
 *
 *		This file is part of the VARCem Project.
 *
 *		Implementation of various machines made by (Groupe) Bull.
 *
 * **NOTE**	This is not finished yet, and, therefore, still in Dev:
 *
 *		 - proper handling of the SW-1 and and SW-2 switches and
 *		   their readout. Fabien is looking into that.
 *		 - figure out how the NCR 83C80 chip is mapped in.
 *		 - figure out why the InPort is detected, but does not work.
 *		 - at some point, hopefully add the Paradise PGA2A chip.
 *
 *		Other than the above, the machine works as expected.
 *
 * Version:	@(#)m_bull.c	1.0.3	2019/05/13
 *
 * Authors:	Fred N. van Kempen, <decwiz@yahoo.com>
 *		Idea from a patch for PCem by DNS2KV2, but fully rewritten.
 *		Many thanks to Fabien Neck for technical info, BIOS and tools.
