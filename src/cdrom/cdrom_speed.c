/*
 * VARCem	Virtual ARchaeological Computer EMulator.
 *		An emulator of (mostly) x86-based PC systems and devices,
 *		using the ISA,EISA,VLB,MCA  and PCI system buses, roughly
 *		spanning the era between 1981 and 1995.
 *
 *		This file is part of the VARCem Project.
 *
 *		Define the various speeds supported by optical devices.
 *
 *		List of usable CD-ROM speeds (from Wikipedia):
 *
 *		 Speed 	KiB/s	 	Mbit/s 	 	RPM
 *		  1x	150 		1.2288  	200-500
 *		  2x	300 		2.4576	 	400-1,000
 *		  4x	600 		4.9152		800-2,000
 *		  6x	?		?		?
 *		  8x	1,200 		9.8304 		1,600-4,000
 *		  10x	1,500 		12.288 	 	2,000-5,000
 *		  12x	1,800 		14.7456 	2,400-6,000
 *		  16x	?		?		?
 *		  20x	1,200-3,000 	up to 24.576 	4,000 (CAV)
 *		  24x	?		?		?
 *		  32x	1,920-4,800 	up to 39.3216 	6,400 (CAV)
 *		  36x	2,160-5,400 	up to 44.2368 	7,200 (CAV)
 *		  40x	2,400-6,000 	up to 49.152 	8,000 (CAV)

 *		  72x	6,750-10,800 	up to 88.4736 	2,000 (multi-beam)
 *
 *		We discard the latter two ones.
