 * VARCem	Virtual ARchaeological Computer EMulator.
 *		An emulator of (mostly) x86-based PC systems and devices,
 *		using the ISA,EISA,VLB,MCA  and PCI system buses, roughly
 *		spanning the era between 1981 and 1995.
 *
 *		This file is part of the VARCem Project.
 *
 *		Implementation of (dummy) PPI module.
 *
 *		IBM 5150 cassette nonsense:
 *		  Calls F979 twice
 *		  Expects CX to be nonzero, BX >$410 and <$540
 *		  CX is loops between bit 4 of $62 changing
 *		  BX is timer difference between calls
